                        <h3>Intro</h3>
                        <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three
                            different
                            beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the
                            neighborhood, as
                            long as
                            he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of
                            not
                            wanting to
                            admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
                        <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release
                            all of
                            his
                            energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving
                            his
                            toys "a
                            ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

                        <p>Cody is a 7yr old Pembroke Corgi. He was born in Cavalier Farms, Seattle. He prefers to spend
                            his
                            days
                            lounging on the bean bag. Every day, he enjoys two walks around the neighborhood and likes
                            to
                            make
                            friends with other doggie friends. If lucky enough, he might see the cyclist, but he is not
                            allowed
                            to

                        <P>Cody loves traveling. He enjoys walking on the beach and taking sun naps. But he hates cold
                            weather.
                            He
                            would like to stay at home lounging by the fireplace in winter.</P>
